        <article> Madden 19 has made big strides in the creation of  video game players having
            the same body type as their real life player. Getting the slimness, bulkiness, and body width right.
            Now I would like if they added the element of wingspan into the game and torso length, but that likely will not happen.
            Also, players moving according to their weight and height. For example, a player that is 6'1, 215 pounds
            runs with a longer stride than a player who is 5'9, 195 pounds, whose leg and arm motions are faster. Along with this,
            players who are bigger have an easier time running people over and it shows in game. A bigger runner has a more explosive
            truck move than a smaller runner where he has to truck and compose himself and regain his balance afterwards.
