        <article> Madden 19 has made big strides in the creation of  video game players having
            the same body type as their real life player. Getting the slimness, bulkiness, and body width right.
            Now I would like if they added the element of wingspan into the game and torso length, but that likely will not happen.
            Also, players moving according to their weight and height. For example, a player that is 6'1, 215 pounds
            runs with a longer stride than a player who is 5'9, 195 pounds, whose leg and arm motions are faster. Along with this,
            players who are bigger have an easier time running people over and it shows in game. A bigger runner has a more explosive
            truck move than a smaller runner where he has to truck and compose himself and regain his balance afterwards.

        <article>What Madden has yet to fix is the artifical AI controlled players and animations.
            The players when  not being controlled by the user of the video game  can make very, very dumb decisions. 
            The CPU players will unnecassarily do a juke move when there the person trying to tackle them is being blocked, 
            or on defense when the ball is in the air, the defensive player will not attempt to make a play on the ball. 
            Another bug in the system is the lack of foul calls when they are needed. During online games, there are times where
            the player on defense hits or grabs a player while the ball is in the air. According football rules, this is a foul,
            called Pass Interference. But it is not always called.
